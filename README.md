# Hypothesis Testing in Python üìä

This repository focuses on **Hypothesis Testing**, a core concept in inferential statistics, implemented using Python. It also includes supporting material on **Confidence Intervals** for a complete understanding of statistical inference.

## üìÇ Repository Contents

* **Hypothesis\_Testing\_Meghana.ipynb** *(Main Notebook)*

  * Formulating **Null (H‚ÇÄ)** and **Alternative (H‚ÇÅ)** hypotheses
  * Performing statistical tests (t-test, z-test, etc.)
  * Step-by-step calculations and Python implementations
  * Drawing clear and practical statistical conclusions

* **Confidence\_Interval\_Meghana.ipynb** *(Supporting Notebook)*

  * Confidence interval estimation
  * Parameter estimation techniques
  * Visual representation of uncertainty

## üöÄ Technologies Used

* Python 3
* Jupyter Notebook
* Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

## üìñ How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/hypothesis-testing-python.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the folder:

   ```bash
   cd hypothesis-testing-python
   ```
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Open the notebooks and run the cells to explore **hypothesis testing and confidence intervals** in action.

## üéØ Learning Outcomes

* Gain a strong understanding of **Hypothesis Testing** (formulation, execution, and interpretation).
* Learn how to apply statistical tests in Python.
* Understand how **Confidence Intervals** complement hypothesis testing.
* Build confidence in drawing data-driven conclusions.
